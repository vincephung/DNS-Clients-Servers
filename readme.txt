Project 2:
Vincent Phung vcp34
1. I implemented my recursive client functionality by having the client connect to the RS and send a query for the IP address. The RS responds with the IP address, or it sends back the hostname of the TS server. If the client receives the TS server name, it connects to the TS server and queries for the IP address again. The TS server sends back the IP address or an error.
2. There are no issues with the attached code.
3. The problems that I faced with the code was working with sending and receiving data from sockets, and also parsing the data from the input files.
4. I learned a lot about creating client servers and DNS servers and how they truly function. I also got more experience using python and more experience working with sockets.
